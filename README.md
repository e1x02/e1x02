I am a cultural scholar studying technology, art, and the construction of capitalist aesthetics in the late 20th and 21st centuries

I am a PhD Student in History and an MA in Art History at Indiana University ([here is my CV](https://elijah.beaton.page/cv.html)). You can get in contact with me at <ewbeaton@iu.edu>

On the side I also do some designâ€”check out [cheap.urls.loan](https://cheap.urls.loan) if you want a cheap little website

<!-- i'm going to be fully honest, i hate github because its so much more "software" than i need. frankly all these projects are better served in a ZIP file -->
